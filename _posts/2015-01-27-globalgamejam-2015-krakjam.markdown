### Disabled sheeps got first place

"**What do we do now?**" was topic for 2015 global game Jam. Topic that could evolve to everything, and it evolve into everything. We had games about vikings, animals, pregnacy, flying squirell and many more. But first place was tooked by blind sheeps.

[Time shepherd](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/time-shepherd) is game about helping blinded sheeps to get to safe zone. They need to bypass lots of traps, and You can help them by slowing down or speed up time. Although there’s a catch, You can modify time only traps only.
